# ds-toolkit

A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in TypeScript.

This library provides a set of well-tested and efficient data structures for use in your TypeScript projects. It aims to be:

* **Comprehensive:** Covering a wide range of basic and advanced data structures.
* **Type-safe:**  Leveraging TypeScript generics for maximum type safety.
* **Well-documented:**  Providing clear explanations and usage examples.
* **Performant:**  Based on recommended algorithms.

1. Basic:
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stack
- Queue (FIFO, Priority Queue)

2. Trees:
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- B-Tree
- Trie

3. Graphs:
- Adjacency list

4. Advanced:
