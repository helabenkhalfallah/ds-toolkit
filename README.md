This library provides a set of well-tested and efficient data structures for use in your TypeScript projects. It aims to be:

* **Comprehensive:** Covering a wide range of basic and advanced data structures.
* **Type-safe:**  Leveraging TypeScript generics for maximum type safety.
* **Well-documented:**  Providing clear explanations and usage examples.
* **Performant:**  Based on recommended algorithms.
